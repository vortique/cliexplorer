# CLIExplorer 👁️

A file **explorer** for **CLI**. This program mostly relies on re-implementations of basic UNIX commands in C# and makes your life easier!

## Commands

The usage of the commands I added and I'm going to add is quite easy to understand and use.


| Command | Description                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ls`    | Lists every directory and file in **c**urrent **w**orking **d**irectory (cwd). |


## Roadmap

Here are the upcoming features planned for future versions:

- [ ] `cwd` (current working directory) command
- [ ] Variable expansion (`$(cwd)` -> Environment.CurrentDirectory)
- [ ] *...and endless ideas in my brain.* 🚀
