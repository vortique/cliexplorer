# CLIExplorer üëÅÔ∏è

A file **explorer** for **CLI**. This program mostly relies on re-implementations of basic UNIX commands in C# and makes your life easier!

## Documentation

All implemented commands are simple and straightforward to use.

| Command         | Description                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ls`            | Lists all directories and files in the **current working directory (cwd)**. |
| `cwd`           | Prints current working directory.                                           |
| `cd <dir>`      | Changes current working directory.                                          |
| `echo <string>` | Prints everything written after the command prefix (echo).                  |
| `exit`          | Exits from program.                                                         |

### Variable Expansion

Replaces every `${<command>}` string with the output of that `<command>`.

**Example**:
```commandline
(C:\Users\vortique) $ cwd
C:\Users\vortique
(C:\Users\vortique) $ echo test ${cwd}
test C:\Users\vortique
```

## Roadmap

Here are the upcoming features planned for future versions:

- [x] `cwd` (current working directory) command
- [x] Variable expansion (`${cwd}` -> Environment.CurrentDirectory)
- [x] `cd` command
- [ ] `cp` command
- [ ] `mv` command
- [ ] `grep` command
- [ ] *...and endless ideas in my brain.* üöÄ
